Pore Aventura is a *3D velocity field explorer*, designed for academic research purposes. It aims at visualizing and investigating the kinematic properties of a steady 3D velocity field, which can contain solid stationary boundaries, like for instance in a porous media.

Among its features, Pore Aventura allows :
* 3D motion through the velocity field
* Local injection of passive advective tracers which flow following their streamline
* Upstream injection grid spawning advective tracers with a tunable grid resolution and spawn delay
* Streamlines visualization
* Roller-coaster mode, flowing the user following its local streamline (like a passive advective tracer)


Pore Aventura was initially developed to investigate dispersion and mixing in porous media, by providing a tool to explore the velocity intermittency, the streamlines tortuosity and the dispersion properties of an experimentally measured 3D velocity field obtained in a porous medium made out of a random stack of monodisperse rigid spherical beads.
